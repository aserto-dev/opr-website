# Introduction

The **Open Policy Registry** is an OCIv2-compatible container registry for policy images. 

It consists of two components:
* The `policy` CLI, which is used to manage policy images, and is modeled after `docker`
* The `opcr.io` registry, which is a hosted OCIv2-compatible container registry that is focused 
exclusively on policy image content

## Getting Started

### Create an opcr.io account and organization

You can use `policy` CLI with other container registries, but a good place to start is 
to [create](/docs/opcr/create-account) an `opcr.io` account. 

### Download the CLI

To get started, you'll need to [download](/docs/cli/download) the `policy` CLI.
