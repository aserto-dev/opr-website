# Introduction

The **Open Policy Registry** is a free, hosted artifact registry that natively supports the OCI media type. You can use it to round-trip public or private policy images built using the [`policy`](https://github.com/opcr-io/policy) CLI from the [Open Policy Containers](https://www.openpolicycontainers.com) project.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](/docs/opcr/create-account) an Open Policy Registry account and organization
2. [Download](/docs/cli/download) the `policy` CLI
3. Follow our 5 minute [tutorial](/docs/tutorial) to get a flavor for what OPCR can do for you
