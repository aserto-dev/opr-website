# Create an account

Go to [opcr.io](https://opcr.io), and create an account with your GitHub account and a valid 
GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

:::note
You can use this [link](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to create a new GitHub PAT.

## Naming your account

The first time through, you will be asked to name your account. You can use the same account 
name that you use for GitHub, or choose a different account name that is unused, and passes 
the account naming conventions (6 or more characters, no obscene words).

## Personal organization

Similar to GitHub accounts, your account name becomes the name of your personal organization.
