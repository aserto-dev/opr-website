# Create an account

Click the `Sign in` button in the top right of the navbar, or go to [console.openpolicyregistry.io](https://console.openpolicyregistry.io), and create an `opcr.io` account with your GitHub account.

:::note
Since OPCR uses GitHub as its identity provider, your account will be named after your GitHub account.

## Organizations

Much like with GitHub or Docker, an organization name provides the first part of a two-part name 
for a policy repository. For example, if your organization is named `foo`, you are able to create 
a repository named `foo/bar`. 

## Naming your personal organization

The first time through, you will be asked to name your organization. You can use your GitHub account name, or choose a different organization name that is unused, and passes the account naming conventions (4 or more characters, no profanity).

:::warning
Choose your organization name carefully - you cannot change it later.
:::

:::note
Currently, only personal organizations are supported. In the future, you'll be able to create 
organizations that have multiple members, similar to GitHub and Docker.
