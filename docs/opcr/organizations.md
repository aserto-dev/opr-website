# Organizations

When you create an account at `opcr.io`, you automatically register a personal organization 
that is associated with this account. 

This follows the GitHub pattern - when you name your account `foo`, you are able to create 
repositories named `foo/*`. 

:::note
Currently, only personal organizations are supported. In the future, you'll be able to create 
organizations that have multiple members, similar to GitHub and Docker.
