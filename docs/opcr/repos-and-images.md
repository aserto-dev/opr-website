# Repositories and Images

Repositories live under organizations.

## Policy repositories

A policy repository is identified using a two-part naming scheme: `org-name/repo-name`.

## Policy images

A policy image is identified using a three-part naming scheme: `org-name/repo-name:tag`.

:::note
Just like with docker images, if the `tag` is omitted, it will default to `:latest`.
